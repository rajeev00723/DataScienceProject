# DataScienceProject

Unsurprisingly, the role of a data scientist primarily involves exploring and analyzing data. The results of an analysis might form the basis of a report or a machine learning model, but it all begins with data, with Python being the most popular programming language for data scientists.

After decades of open-source development, Python provides extensive functionality with powerful statistical and numerical libraries:

    NumPy and Pandas simplify analyzing and manipulating data
    Matplotlib provides attractive data visualizations
    Scikit-learn offers simple and effective predictive data analysis
    TensorFlow and PyTorch supply machine learning and deep learning capabilities

Usually, a data analysis project is designed to establish insights around a particular scenario or to test a hypothesis.


For example, suppose a university professor collects data from their students, including the number of lectures attended, the hours spent studying, and the final grade achieved on the end of term exam. The professor could analyze the data to determine if there is a relationship between the amount of studying a student undertakes and the final grade they achieve. The professor might use the data to test a hypothesis that only students who study for a minimum number of hours can expect to achieve a passing grade.

Explore data with NumPy and Pandas


Data scientists can use various tools and techniques to explore, visualize, and manipulate data. One of the most common ways in which data scientists work with data is to use the Python language and some specific packages for data processing.

What is NumPy

NumPy is a Python library that gives functionality comparable to mathematical tools such as MATLAB and R. While NumPy significantly simplifies the user experience, it also offers comprehensive mathematical functions.

What is Pandas
Pandas is an extremely popular Python library for data analysis and manipulation. Pandas is like excel for Python - providing easy-to-use functionality for data tables.


Explore data in a Jupyter notebook
Jupyter notebooks are a popular way of running basic scripts using your web browser. Typically, these notebooks are a single webpage, broken up into text sections and code sections that are executed on the server rather than your local machine. This means you can get started quickly without needing to install Python or other tools.

Testing hypotheses
Data exploration and analysis is typically an iterative process, in which the data scientist takes a sample of data and performs the following kinds of task to analyze it and test hypotheses:

    Clean data to handle errors, missing values, and other issues.
    Apply statistical techniques to better understand the data, and how the sample might be expected to represent the real-world population of data, allowing for random variation.
    Visualize data to determine relationships between variables, and in the case of a machine learning project, identify features that are potentially predictive of the label.
    Revise the hypothesis and repeat the process.
